## Testing SQLite Handler with [Dataset Name](URL to the Dataset)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```
CREATE DATABASE wild_fire      --- display name for database.
WITH ENGINE='sqlite',
PARAMETERS={
    "db_file": "mindsdb/integrations/handlers/sqlite_handler/FPA_FOD_20170508.db"               --- this points to the database file that the connection is to be made to
};
```

![CREATE_DATABASE](db_connection.png)

**2. Testing CREATE PREDICTOR**

```
CREATE MODEL 
  mindsdb.Fire_origin_model_3
FROM wild_fire
  (SELECT FIRE_YEAR,LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,DISCOVERY_DATE, STAT_CAUSE_DESCR FROM wild_fire.Fires LIMIT 100000)
PREDICT STAT_CAUSE_DESCR;
```

![CREATE_PREDICTOR](predictor_model.png)

**3. Testing SELECT FROM PREDICTOR**

```
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name='fire_origin_model_3';
```

![SELECT_FROM](prediction_result.png)

### Results
```
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name='fire_origin_model_3';
```
![DROP_MODEL](model_drop.png)

- [x] Works Great ðŸ’š (This means that all the steps were executed successfuly and the expected outputs were returned.)
