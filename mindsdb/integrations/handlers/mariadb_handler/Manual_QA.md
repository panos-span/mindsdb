## Testing MariaDB Handler with [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mariadb_test  --- display name for database. 
WITH ENGINE = 'mariadb',      --- name of the mindsdb handler 
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "demo_user",                  --- Your database user.
    "password": "demo_password",          --- Your password.
    "host": "cloud.mindsdb.com",          --- host, it can be an ip or an url. 
    "port": "3306",                      --- common port is 3306.
    "database": "files"                  --- The name of your database *optional.
};
```

![CREATE_DATABASE](create-db.png)

**2. Testing CREATE PREDICTOR**

```sql
CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb.iris_predictor
FROM mariadb_test (
    SELECT * FROM iris_data
) PREDICT species;
```

![CREATE_PREDICTOR](predictor.png)

**3. Testing SELECT FROM PREDICTOR**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name='iris_predictor';
```

![SELECT_FROM](predict-db.png)
