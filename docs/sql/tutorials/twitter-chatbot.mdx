In this section, we present how to build a chatbot for Twitter using MindsDB and GPT-3.

<Tip>
Make sure you have access to a working MindsDB installation, either locally or at [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/).
</Tip>

## Connecting a Twitter Account

Please note that a Twitter developer account is required to follow this tutorial.

Follow the instructions on the [Twitter developer website](https://developer.twitter.com/en) to generate API keys.

To connect your Twitter account, you need a bearer token that can be obtained following [these steps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens).

Now, you are ready to connect your Twitter account to MindsDB.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_twitter 
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'twitter',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "bearer_token": "twitter bearer token",
      "consumer_key": "twitter consumer key",
      "consumer_secret": "twitter consumer key secret",
      "access_token": "twitter access token",
	  "access_token_secret": "twitter access token secret"
    };
```

The [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement creates a database called `my_twitter` that contains a table called `tweets`.

## Searching and Writing Tweets

Here is how to search tweets containing `mindsdb` keyword:

```sql
SELECT id, created_at, author_username, text 
FROM my_twitter.tweets 
WHERE query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply'
AND created_at > '2023-02-16' 
LIMIT 20;
```

Alternatively, we can use a Twitter native query, as below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_twitter (
  search_recent_tweets(
    query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply',
    start_time = '2023-02-16T00:00:00.000Z',
    max_results = 2
  )
);
```

<Tip>

Here is how to write tweets:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_twitter.tweets (reply_to_tweet_id, text)
VALUES 
    (1626198053446369280, 'MindsDB is great! now its super simple to build ML powered apps'),
    (1626198053446369280, 'Holy!! MindsDB is the best thing they have invented for developers doing ML');
```

We write tweets by inserting values into the `tweets` table.

## Responding to Tweets

Let's create an OpenAI model to respond to tweets.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.twitter_response_model                           
PREDICT response
USING
  engine = 'openai', 
  max_tokens = 200,             
  prompt_template = 'from tweet "{{text}}" by "{{author_username}}", if their comment is a question invite them to join the MindsDB slack using this link http://bitly.com/abc. Otherwise, simply write a thank you message';
```

This model responds to tweets as instructed in the `prompt_template` parameter.

<Tip>

</Tip>

Here is how you can get a response by manually querying the model:

```sql
SELECT response
FROM mindsdb.twitter_response_model 
WHERE author_username = '@pedro'
AND text = 'I love this, can I learn more?';
```

Follow along to see how to automate the responses.

## Automating Responses to Tweets

Finally, we create a chatbot by automating responses to tweets using jobs.

<Tip>
To learn more about jobs, visit our docs [here](/sql/create/jobs).
</Tip>

Let's create a job that runs every hour, checks for new tweets, and responds using the OpenAI model.

```sql
CREATE JOB auto_respond AS (

    INSERT INTO my_twitter.tweets (in_reply_to_tweet_id, text)
        SELECT 
            t.id AS in_reply_to_tweet_id, 
            r.response AS text
        FROM my_twitter.tweets t
        JOIN mindsdb.twitter_response_model r 
        WHERE t.query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply' 
        AND t.created_at > "{{PREVIOUS_START_DATETIME}}"
        LIMIT 2
)
EVERY hour;
```

The `EVERY hour` clause ensures the job runs once every hour. The job uses the [`SELECT`](/sql/api/select) statement to join the data table with the model table and get responses for tweets posted after the `{{PREVIOUS_START_DATETIME}}` timestamp. Then, the [`INSERT INTO`](/sql/api/insert) statement writes these responses to the `tweets` table of the `my_twitter` integration.
