This is the implementation of the YugabyteDB data handler for MindsDB.

[YugabyteDB](https://www.yugabyte.com/) is a high-performance, cloud-native distributed SQL database that aims to support all PostgreSQL features. It is best fit for cloud-native OLTP (i.e. real-time, business-critical) applications that need absolute data correctness and require at least one of the following: scalability, high tolerance to failures, or globally-distributed deployments.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using `psycopg2`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on the YugabyteDB database.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the YugabyteDB database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE yugabyte_datasource
WITH
    engine = 'yugabyte',
    parameters = {
        "user": "admin",
        "password": "1234",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 5433,
        "database": "yugabyte"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM yugabyte_datasource.demo;
```

<Note>
If you are using YugabyteDB Cloud with MindsDB Cloud, you need to add `0.0.0.0\0` to `allow IP list` for accessing it publicly.
