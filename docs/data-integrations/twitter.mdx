In this section, we present how to integrate a Twitter account with MindsDB.

## Connection

Here are the requirements to connect a Twitter account to MindsDB:

1. You need a Twitter developer account.
2. You need to generate API keys following the instructions on the [Twitter developer website](https://developer.twitter.com/en).
3. To connect your Twitter account, you need a bearer token that can be obtained following [these steps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens).

Here is how to connect your Twitter account to MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_twitter 
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'twitter',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "bearer_token": "twitter bearer token",
      "consumer_key": "twitter consumer key",
      "consumer_secret": "twitter consumer key secret",
      "access_token": "twitter access token",
	  "access_token_secret": "twitter access token secret"
    };
```

## Usage

The `my_twitter` database contains a table called `tweets` by default.

Here is how to search tweets containing `mindsdb` keyword:

```sql
SELECT id, created_at, author_username, text 
FROM my_twitter.tweets 
WHERE query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply'
AND created_at > '2023-02-16' 
LIMIT 20;
```

Alternatively, you can use a Twitter native query, as below:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_twitter (
  search_recent_tweets(
    query = '(mindsdb OR #mindsdb) -is:retweet -is:reply',
    start_time = '2023-02-16T00:00:00.000Z',
    max_results = 2
  )
);
```

Here is how to write tweets:

```sql
INSERT INTO my_twitter.tweets (reply_to_tweet_id, text)
VALUES 
    (1626198053446369280, 'MindsDB is great! now its super simple to build ML powered apps'),
    (1626198053446369280, 'Holy!! MindsDB is the best thing they have invented for developers doing ML');
```
