This is the implementation of the BigQuery data handler for MindsDB.

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. It is a Platform-as-a-Service that supports querying using ANSI SQL.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `google-cloud-bigquery` Python library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `project_id` is a globally unique identifier for your project.
* `service_account_keys` is a full path to the service account key file.

<Tip>
For more info about creating and managing the service account key visit [this page](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the BigQuery database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bqdataset
WITH
   engine = "bigquery",
   parameters = {
      "project_id": "tough-future-332513",
      "service_account_keys": "/home/user/MyProjects/tough-future-332513.json"
   };
```

You can use this established connection to query your dataset as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM bgdataset.dataset.table
LIMIT 10;
```
